This program prints out a series of instructions for a comuputer to get from where I am sitting in my living room to the bathroom
on the floor above me.  This is an exercise in ch. 2 of Programming Principles & Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup which I 
am using to learn C++ in depth and in order to build viable software.
